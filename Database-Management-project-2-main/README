# Database-Management-project-2
#
Use Java 21 for this project. Download LinHashMap.java, BpTreeMap.java, and FileList.java.
These are only partially implemented, so you need to finish the implementations. Redo Project
1 and use Indexing (LinHashMap and BpTreeMap) to speed up the RA operators. Also, now
duplicates should be eliminated as indexing makes it efficient to do so.
Note 1: You need to implement all methods that have ”TO BE IMPLEMENTED”.
Note 2: You need to modify your code from Project 1 to use indexing in the 5 RA operators.
Note 3: You need to eliminate duplicate columns.
Note 4: You will receive 10 bonus points if you complete the implementation of FileList.java.
