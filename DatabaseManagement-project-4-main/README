For the Term Project (Database Application with Web Access) a two-page proposal giving a
detailed description of the application you propose to develop must be submitted before Spring
Break. The proposal must indicate Web Framework (e.g., SpringBoot, or Play 2), DBMS Access
via JDBC, Ebeans, or Hibernate, and Database (MySQL or PostgreSQL, unless permission).
The proposal requires an initial UML Class Diagram for your proposed database (should have
5 to 9 tables).
Note: The proposal must be submitted before the Spring Break.
The Term Project includes database design (UML Class Diagram, 3NF/BCNF Normalization),
population, and Web-based application development. The Term Project including a demo will
be presented during the last week of class. Worth twice the points of regular programming
projects.
Rubric for Final Presentations:
• Design Schema 1 using a UML Class Diagram
• Translate UML to Relational Model
• Design Schema 2 using the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) Decomposition Algorithm
• Design Schema 3 using the Third Normal Form (3NF) Synthesis Algorithm
• Compare the three designs
• Show final schema in SQL and explain constraints
• Discuss Software Architecture and Components
• Demo Secure Logins (password handling and SQL injection prevention)
• Demo Database Queries
• Demo Database Updates and Transactions
