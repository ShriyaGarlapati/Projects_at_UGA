# Database-Management-project-1
Requirement
Use Java 21 for this project. Download Table.java, KeyType.java, MovieDB.java, and
MovieDB2.java. In Table.java, comment out LinHashMap and BpTreeMap (they are
used for Project 2). Finish the implementation the 5 RA Operators that are partially implemented in Table.java. Store tuples in an ArrayList. Use MapType.NO MAP for the index
type (no indexing for Project 1).
Submission instruction
Create a subdirectory called store containing the data file for the relations. Also, create the
report.txt containing the name of all members of the team and stating what each programmer
did and how well they did it. Put report.txt, store, and all four .java files in a directory
Project1 LastNameofTheManager and zip this directory and submit the .zip file on ELC.
Only one submission should be made by each group.
